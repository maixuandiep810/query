Unit 9

Kinesthetic leamers may find it difficult to sit still in a conventional classroom. They need to be physically active and take frequent breaks. When they are bored, they fidget in their seats. They prefer to sit someÂ­place where there is room to move about. They benefit from manipulating materials and learn best when classroom subjects such as math, science, and reading are processed through hands-on experiences.
Incorporating arts-and-crafts activities, building projects, and sports into lessons help kinesthetic learners process new information. Physical expressions of encouragement, such as a pat on the back, are often appreciated.
